# Curated List of Internet Radio Streams

This is my (awesome) list of internet radio streams
broadcast on the web from an [icecast](https://icecast.org)/
[shoutcast](https://www.shoutcast.com) server
or via [HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming)
or [DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP)
or whatever.
These streams can be played by many media players
(e.g. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org))
or played by opening the stream URL directly in a web browser.

There are other lists like this online
but they always seem to have outdated, broken links.
While I'm capable, I'll maintain this list,
pruning or updating streams whose links are dead as I notice them.
Buuuuuuut since this is a git repo, 
we can make this maintenance a collaborative effort:

  - If you find a stream that is not longer working, either 
  [open an issue](https://github.com/mikepierce/internet-radio-streams/issues) for it
  or just go ahead and fix it: find a working stream URL, 
  add it to the top of the corresponding m3u file, and make a pull request.
  If a stream looks indefinitely "off-air", 
  move the corresponding m3u file to the _DEMOTED_ directory and make a pull request.
  - If you'd like to suggest a stream to be added to the list,
  [let me know](https://github.com/mikepierce/internet-radio-streams/discussions/categories/station-suggestions).

The streams in the _DEMOTED_ directory have either gone "off-air"
or have simply been removed from the list because I don't listen to them.
