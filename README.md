This is my curated list 
of [Icecast](https://icecast.org)/[SHOUTcast](https://www.shoutcast.com) internet radio stations 
that I enjoy or find novel.
One can play these streams with [ncmpcpp](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ncmpcpp) 
or [VLC](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VLC_media_player), 
or with a web browser.
I've seen other lists like this online, usually in a plain-text gist,
but many of the links are brokenâ€”I'll keep this list
updated and working as I have time.
But as a git repo, we can make this a collaborative effort:

  - If you find a stream that is not longer working,
    either [open an issue](https://github.com/mikepierce/internet-radio-streams/issues) for it,
    or just fix it: find the working URL and make a pull request.
  - If you'd like to suggest a new station,
    [start a discussion](https://github.com/mikepierce/internet-radio-streams/discussions/categories/station-suggestions).

The streams in the _OffAir_ directory don't work,
either because the corresponding station has gone off the air,
or because their stream URL changed 
and I either couldn't or didn't want to find it.
