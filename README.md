# Curated List of Internet Radio Streams

[![Buy Me a Coffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20Me%20a-Coffee-orange)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mpierce)

This is my curated list of good
[Icecast](https://icecast.org) /
[SHOUTcast](https://www.shoutcast.com) /
[HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) /
[DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP) 
internet radio stations.
These streams can be played with [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org)/[ncmpcpp](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ncmpcpp) 
or [VLC](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VLC_media_player), 
or just through a web browser.

There are other lists like this online
    but they always seem to have outdated/broken links.
    I'll try to keep the links in this list updated 
    as I have time and attention.
    Buuuuuuuut, since this is a git repo, 
let's just make it a collaborative effort:

  - If you find a stream that is not longer working,
    either [open an issue](https://github.com/mikepierce/internet-radio-streams/issues) for it,
    or just go ahead and fix it by finding a working stream URL, 
    adding it to the corresponding m3u file, and making a pull request.
    If a stream looks indefinitely down, move it to the _DEMOTED_ directory.
  - If you'd like to suggest a new station,
    [start a discussion](https://github.com/mikepierce/internet-radio-streams/discussions/categories/station-suggestions).

The streams in the _DEMOTED_ directory 
have either gone off-air
or have simply been removed 
because I don't intend to listen to them.
