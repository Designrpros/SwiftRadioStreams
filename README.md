# Curated List of Internet Radio Streams

[![Buy Me a Coffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20Me%20a-Coffee-orange)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mpierce)

This is my curated list 
of [Icecast](https://icecast.org)/[SHOUTcast](https://www.shoutcast.com) internet radio stations.
These streams can be played with [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org)/[ncmpcpp](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ncmpcpp) 
or [VLC](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VLC_media_player), 
or just through a web browser.

There are other lists like this online
but they've always got old outdated broken links.
I'll try to keep the links in this list updated as I have time
and when I notice they go down.
Buuut, since this is a git repo, let's make it a collaborative effort:

  - If you find a stream that is not longer working,
    either [open an issue](https://github.com/mikepierce/internet-radio-streams/issues) for it,
    or just go ahead and fix it by finding a working stream URL, 
    adding it to the corresponding m3u file, and making a pull request.
  - If you'd like to suggest a new station for the list,
    [start a discussion](https://github.com/mikepierce/internet-radio-streams/discussions/categories/station-suggestions).

The streams in the _OffAir_ directory don't work;
their streams no longer worked 
and I was uninterested in fixing them.
